final = immutable
git helps control code and versions

after git init, any file will be included inside the working directory git init

when in doubt, run git status to check

do not want to save anything compiled from the source in git (NOTE: EVERYTHING IS PERMANENT)
e.g. classes, dont include any directory called classes or files ending with .classes
e.g. temp files, api keys, passwords, git hub will disable stuff we commit with passwords






git overview:
working directory (red) -> staging area (green) -> repository

if modified something in staging area, it goes back to the WD
git add. git add . to move files from wd to staging
git commit -m "initial commit"  to commit, this moves from staging area to repository (permanent)
:q! to exit the VI if we forget the -m

git push: 

clean means the files in WD, staging, respository are all the same

git log shows Author: name <email>  Date: day date time

rmdir /s /q .git removes a git repository in the repository's root directory




GIT
git add -> git commit -> git push (wd ->s, s -> lr, lr -> GitHub)'
